title: Upgrade authentik
---

Upgrading to the latest version of authentik, whether a new major release or a patch, involves running a few commands to pull down the latest packages and then restart the servers and databases.

:::warning
The version of the authentik instance and any outposts must be the same. We recommended that you always upgrade any outposts at the same time you upgrade your authentik instance.
