Property Mappings allow you to pass information to external applications. For example, pass the current user's groups as a SAML parameter. Property Mappings are also used to map Source fields to authentik fields, for example when using LDAP.

For Provider Property Mappings, see [this page](../providers/property-mappings/index.md).

For Source Property Mappings, see [this page](../sources/property-mappings/index.md).
